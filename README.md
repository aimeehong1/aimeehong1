🎯 Featured Project: Motor Control Analysis <br>
Check out my work on this motor control classification project for MathWorks! My team and I developed a model to predict motor fault and anomalies based on their electrical and mechanical signals, helping the company simulate the model in a closed-loop environment and understand the business implications and tradeoffs of each model.

Tools: MATLAB and Simulink <br>
What We Did: Preprocessed and filtered vibration signals generated from our system of three-phase induction motors. Then we analyzed the data using supervised learning and deep learning approaches. <br>
Results: Achieved 87.5% accuracy, precision score of 87.5%, and recall score of 88.4%. Provided insights that helped balance model performance with computational intensity and business implications.
