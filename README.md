🎯 Featured Project: Sentiment Analysis for American ExpressLinks to an external site.
Check out my work on this sentiment analysis project for American Express! My team and I developed a model to analyze customer feedback from social media, helping the company extract valuable insights to improve their customer support.

Tools: Python, spaCy, scikit-learn
What We Did: Preprocessed and vectorized text data using spaCy, then built an SVM classifier to predict sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
Results: Achieved 85% accuracy, outperforming the baseline by 20%, and provided insights that helped guide data-driven improvements in customer service.
